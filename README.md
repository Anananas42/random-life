# random-life

Fun project to train some data science and web scraping.

Imagine if you were born now and the world stayed the same.
What would your life look like? Where would you be born? What education level would you achieve? How would you die?

This is an interactive way to explore how the world looks today using stories. It helps us realize how big or little our country is compared to the rest of the world
and how will we probably die.

Hopefully this will be both fun and educational.

TBD:
1) Country of birth ✔️
2) Death cause ✔️
3) Achieved education ❌
4) Average income (PPP Adjusted) ❌
5) Religion ❌
